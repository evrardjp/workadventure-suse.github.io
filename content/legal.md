## Information on Data Processing for SUSE Hackweek workadventu.re
### Background
You are about to participate in the openSUSE Hackweek Workadventu.re. In order to facilitate your participation and to administer hackweek , SUSE Software Solutions Germany GmbH and its corporate affiliates (“SUSE Group”) must process certain personal data which you provide (“Personal Data”).

### Controller
The controller of the processing for the purposes of Article 4(7) GDPR is SUSE Software Solutions Germany GmbH, Maxfeldstraße 5, 90409 Nuremberg, Germany. SUSE’s Data Protection Officer is Mr. Stefan Eigler, TÜV Rheinland i-Sec GmbH, Am Grauen Stein, 51105 Cologne, Germany. The SUSE Group privacy policy is available at https://www.suse.com/company/legal/#privacy-policy.

### Purpose of Processing
We need to process your Personal Data to provision and administer SUSE’s Hackweek workadventu.re and to ensure you can participate.

### Categories of Data Processed
We expect to process Personal Data such as your chosen username, your video/audio stream (the  videoconferencing module uses SUSE’s meet.opensuse.org platform, which is hosted on SUSE’s AWS instance in Frankfurt, Germany) as well as any information you share with us through the chat function. However, please be aware that Personal Data entered in comments, free text fields etc cannot be effectively anonymised or deleted. We ask you to never include sensitive categories of Personal Data (see Art 9 GDPR) when you use meet.opensuse.org.

### Grounds for Processing
We are processing your Personal Data according to Art 6 1(a) GDPR, under which we require your fully informed consent. This notice provides the necessary information about the processing of your Personal Data.

### Recipients of Personal Data
Some Personal Data (e.g. server and application logfiles retained for security purposes) will be processed by those SUSE Group employees who are responsible for the day-to-day running of the SUSE Hackweek workadventu.re instance. Transfer of your Personal Data to SUSE Group entities outside the EEA is covered by a multi-entity data processing agreement which incorporates the Standard Contractual Clauses (“model clauses”). Additionally, SUSE uses Amazon Web Services (tenant in Frankfurt, Germany) to provide part of the infrastructure behind meet.opensuse.org. The Amazon Web Services privacy policy is available at https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/. A data processing agreement is in place between SUSE and Amazon/AWS which incorporates the standard contractual clauses and which specifies that processing takes place in Frankfurt, Germany.

We will permanently and irrevocably delete your Personal Data four (4) weeks after the termination of the SUSE Hackweek.
