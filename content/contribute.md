Talk to us on the #workadventure-at-suse rocketchat channel!

All the existing maps and code can be found in our [Github Organization](https://github.com/workadventure-suse).
Just ping us on the rocketchat channel and we can add you there.

We are also on the hack week [project page](https://hackweek.suse.com/20/projects/workadventu-dot-re-at-suse).

## Contributing maps
### Building a map
You can start building your own map right away without any human contact :)
There is a very good tutorial that we recommend on the official [workadventu.re page](https://workadventu.re/map-building).
Just start following their tutorial and you will be good to go!

Please follow some basic rules when you start:
- **Copyright**: Check that you don't violate any copyrights of artists. Preferably choose art that is licenced [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). If you use other licences, please double-check if you are allowed to use them in this case and throw in a textfile for attribution that we can include at our [credits page](/credits).
- **Office models**: Please do not model your real office building. You can model office-inspired buildings, but keep in mind that we don't want to make it too easy for tailgaters :)
- **Exits**: Always have an exit to the [main map](https://play.wa.suse.net/_/global/wa.suse.net/office/map.json) that is marked very well.

If you need some map examples to get you started, can check out the main map [here](https://github.com/workadventure-suse/office) or take a look at the other maps [here](https://github.com/workadventure-suse).

Feel free to ask for help in our rocketchat channel!

### Integrate your map into the world
After you have built your map, you can ping @crichter or @cahu at the #workadventure-at-suse rocketchat channel and we will discuss how we link your map from the main map.
